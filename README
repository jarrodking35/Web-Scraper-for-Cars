This project was designed to actually help me find a car in real life. I needed a way to take in a lot of information and sift through it quickly so I built a small web scraper to go on carmax and output a csv file
that contains  price, milage, mpg, engine/gas, drive type, transmission, color, and the url. With this, I can bypass the normal car comparing tool on carmax and compare many more than 6 cars at once. While this is not 
all the information I need to make a decision on a car, it does include key points that allow me to immediately rule out cars such as how many cylinders the engine is, what kind of transmission it has, and if it has 
Four Wheel Drive or not. With this, I can skip a lot of the time it would take to tediously compare cars on their website. It also gives me a chance to see if I can gain any types of insight on pricing of a car 
that may not be apparent to the naked eye.
